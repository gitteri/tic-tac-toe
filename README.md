# Tic-Tac-Toe

This app contains basic scaffolding for building out a Tic-Tac-Toe game. It's written using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and [ES6](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) (though vanilla javascript works just fine, too).

## Requirements:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>=4.x, 6.x preferred)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run tests
npm run test
```

## Notes

* This application was built based on the 'simple webpack' template using the [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).
* For detailed explanation on how the scaffolding works, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
